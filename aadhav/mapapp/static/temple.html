                This temple was built by viswanatha nayak who ruled madurai. Lord Vishnu appeared in his dream and told
                that there is a idol below the stone post in the foothills of western ghats and it was him.He told him to 
                take the idol and built a temple and worship him.So the king raised a temple and named it as Kambarayar perumal
                as it was found under the stone post(KAMBAM) and hence the name of our place as "cumbum".He also bring kaasi 
                vishwanathar idol from kasi-varanasi and raised a temple for him also.
